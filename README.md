# Touching experience with a Raspberry Pi

### Hardware

- Raspberry Pi (2, 3, Zero or Zero W)
- MakeyMakey (Custom solution can be made with another board)
- Portable power bank (battery)
- Speaker

We were triyng to create little React app that uses Chrome's [Speech Synthesis API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2014/01/Web-apps-that-talk-Introduction-to-the-Speech-Synthesis-API) to speak after a keypress event generated by a MakeyMakey but we have two problems with this:

- Doesn't work without Internet.
- The API doesn't work with Chromium (default browser for Raspbian, Raspberry Pi OS).

### Our solution

We use the Google Cloud [Text-to-Speech API](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/) to generate `.mp3` for each key event so we can use it offline.

## Install

- Create credentials for the Google Text-to-Speech API [here](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/quickstart-client-libraries) (You will need to add a billing account).

- Add variable to `.bashrc`

```sh
echo "export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=\"/home/pi/rpi-touching-experience/credentials.json\"" >> ~/.bashrc
```

- Install dependencies

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

- Generate audio

```sh
python3 synthesize_text.py
```

- Execute program

```
python3 run.py
```
